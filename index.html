            <p>I'm passionate about creating great user experiences through tasteful and intuitive UIs that look stunning on both desktop and mobile screens.  Even though my focus is on front-end development, I still took the time to immerse myself in backend technologies so I could build full-stack applications for my clients who need them.</p>

                    <img src="images/mernStack.png" alt="MERN Logo">

                    <i class="fas fa-angle-double-up fa-2x opacity"></i>
                    <span><strong>MERN Stack - </strong>
                    My focus is on JavaScript based web development, and this technology stack unifies the process from database to user-interface with one, universal language.  JS is not a perfect language, but its improvements and additions over the years make it a leading contender to dominate the web, and I'm proud to be a part of it.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="images/react-logo.png" alt="React Logo">

                    <i class="fas fa-angle-double-up fa-2x opacity"></i>
                    <span><strong>React.js - </strong>
                    I am competent in the latest, best, and enterprise level practices used in this frontend framework.  Using functional components, managing global app state with Context API and Redux, as well as working with pre-built component libraries like Material-UI and Materialize give me the ability to create complex and responsive web-apps in a relatively short amount of time.</span>
                </li>

                    <img src="images/node-logo.png" alt="Node Logo">

                    <i class="fas fa-angle-double-up fa-2x opacity"></i>
                    <span><strong>Node.js - </strong>
                    Thanks to Google with their development of the V8 JavaScript engine, developers like me have access to building powerful backends while taking advantage of the same logic-flow and syntax we are already familiar with on the client side.  I use Node exclusively and I know its quirks, as well as the most commonly used modules in its package library.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="images/css-logo.png" alt="CSS Logo">

                    <i class="fas fa-angle-double-up fa-2x opacity"></i>
                    <span><strong>CSS3 - </strong>
                    CSS is not a difficult language, in fact any developer knows how to use it to some degree.  However, many of them don't take the time to dive deep on not only the core concepts, but also the advanced and latest features like I did.  My focused study of the language gives me insight into high-performance selectors, complex specifity, and intuitive class naming.</span>

                    <i class="fas fa-angle-double-up fa-2x opacity"></i>
                    <span><strong>JavaScript ES6 - </strong>
                    This latest, <em>stable</em> version of JS is a miracle worker.  I like it because it takes the more repetitive and frequently used methods, and shortens them into cleaner, easier code.  Many times, writing JS can feel like Sisyphus rolling his stone up the hill, but with ES6 I can move through workflow with ease, making me more efficient at producing results.</span>
                </li>

                    <img src="images/github-logo.png" alt="Github Logo">

                    <i class="fas fa-angle-double-up fa-2x opacity"></i>
                    <span><strong>Git, Github - </strong>
                    Version control is extremely important, and I use the Command Line to make steady commits to my local and remote repositories, and make sure to include detailed messages with each one.  I may not be 'hacker-level' good with the CLI, but I do know how to create new directories, start and return to projects, and push or pull from Github with just a few keystrokes.</span>
                </li>

                    <span><strong>MongoDB - </strong>
                    This database fits in perfectly with my development style.  The Node package Mongoose takes care of a lot of heavy lifting so I can easily create data schema, and make relationships between different collections of data.  It makes use of JSON for data structuring which is second nature for a JavaScript programmer like myself.</span>

            <img class="bio-icon" src="images/biography.png" alt="biography icon">
            <p>I'm a classically trained musician who earned a degree in classical guitar performance, and a former chef of fine dining restaurants.  Both of these skills contribute to my ability to understand user experience in a fundamental way.</p>
            <p>My previous experience studying music gave me an eye for detail that allows me to spot errors in code, as well as create pixel-perfect layouts.  This comes from years of analyzing musical scores for the slightest marks of ink on the page that can convey a completely different meaning.  I also learned the value of presenting polished works to my audience through hours of honing and perfecting my craft.</p>
            <p>In the chef world, I had to learn how to communicate quickly and effectively with my team to get the desired results.  In the kitchen everything is "on-the-fly" and every deadline is immediate!  Working in fine-dining gave me the ability to take something as chaotic as a bustling kitchen, and display it in a neat, beautiful package to deliver to the guests, and do it hundreds of times a night.</p>

            <img class="programmer-icon" src="images/programmer.png" alt="programmer-icon">
            <p>The pandemic unfortunately left me jobless almost immediately.  But this was the perfect opportunity I needed to transition into a career with longevity and stability, even in an uncertain ecomony.</p>
            <p>I took it upon myself to learn web development, and I knew I wanted to focus on front-end.  I taught myself with the help of many online courses, bootcamps, and tutorials until I became adept in best practices using modern CSS, JavaScript, and one of the most in-demand front-end frameworks: React.js.</p>
            <p>My learning continues every day.  I'm always looking for new tricks and tips, and building constantly, even if they are only personal projects for my own development.  Aside from that, I have had a handful of real-world clients that I was able to help build websites for, and it has been extremely rewarding.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I would like to join a team of developers so I can advance to the next stage of my new career.</p>

                <p class="reveal-text">Food has always been a passion of mine.  When I was young I used to crack open my grandmother's cookbook and proceed to make a giant mess in the kitchen trying to recreate her famous fudge recipe, or bake a loaf of bread.  I love playing with food science, and making complex recipes from scratch.  Some of my favorite celebrity chefs are Alton Brown, Anthony Bourdain, and Marco Pierre White.</p>

                <p>Ever since I found my father's old guitar in a closet one day, I was smitten by the instrument and music in general.  The mainstream industry doesn't really hold my attention, but I always acknowledge the classics (and instant classics) while searching for the deep-cuts, or the hidden gems.  My favorite part of going to church as a child was the hymns, especially around Christmas time.  Learning the depths of music theory was fun for me where it would send the average person begging for calculus.</p>

                <p>Sports and games of skill are my forte.  I'm a halfway decent bowler, and in my prime I could hustle 9-ball with the best of my local pool hall.  Now, I'm bent on becoming an adequate golfer no matter how many putters I break!  I don't always put up the best scores but on my good days I can smack a 300 yard drive.  My goal is to one day shoot an 80 or less on a regulation 18, but that's a long way off.  I'm just happy if I can get a couple hours out on the golf course.</p>

                <p>Growing up, video games were always my favorite escape.  We had an original NES in the garage and my brother and I would take turns playing Mario 3 with all the neighbor kids.  When I finally got my first gameboy I played Pokemon Red ad nauseam, and I still get the occasional nostalgia about it.  Now that I have a gaming PC, I still find myself playing older classics like Halo and Minecraft, but my favorite games right now are Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Mario Maker 2</p>
